# How to use

This is a small React project that tracks a user's library. It connects to an external API to fetch results from keywords that the user may search for.

State is tracked accross pages so the local library is always up-to-date as long as the server is running.


To install:

```npm install```

```npm start```

Navigate to:
`http://localhost:3000/`
